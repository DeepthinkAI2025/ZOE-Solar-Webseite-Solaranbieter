The Xantrex XW series, and the OutBack GFX series inverters are primarily standalone inverters that can function as an intertie inverter at the same time, but with a lower efficiency than an inverter designed for grid-tie only. The new Xantrex XW is a grid-tie inverter [...] and Xantrex XW series inverters can be ganged together for up to 36 kW of output and can operate off-grid or grid-tie.
